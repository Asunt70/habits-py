Here’s your updated README with clear steps for creating a `.venv`, installing dependencies, and then building the project. I kept the tone tight and dev-friendly:

## Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Before building or running HabitPy, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/asuntx/habitpy.git
cd habitpy

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install .
```

---

### 🚀 Option 1: Build and Install from Source (Recommended)

note: \* is the version and name it might change so just copy the name of the whl file

```bash
# Build the distribution
python -m build

# Install the built package globally
pip install dist/habitpy-*.whl
```

---

### ⚡ Option 2: Use pipx (Recommended for CLI tools)

```bash
# Build the distribution
python -m build

# Install with pipx (ensures global availability)
pipx install dist/habitpy-*.whl
```

---

### 🧪 Option 3: Development Installation

#### With pip (editable mode)

```bash
# Already inside .venv
pip install -e .
```

#### With uv

```bash
uv sync
uv run habitpy setup
```

#### With pipx (editable mode)

```bash
pipx install -e .
```
